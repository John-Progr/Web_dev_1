                        <p>In this project,which is written in python,it takes a review text file<br>
                            and it classifies it as positive or negative using a possibility<br>
                            We have trained a set of weights using logistic regression,giving the<br>
                            algorithm a lot of  of true positive and true negative reviews(supervised learning)<br>

                           a distributed system where songs are distributed through <br>

                           eventually(Consumer).Consumer is made in android studio,so the user can <br>
