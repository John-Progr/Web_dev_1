                        <p> Unlike symmetric key cryptography<br>
                          we do not find historical use of <br>
                          public-key cryptography. It is a relatively<br>
                           new concept.Symmetric cryptography was well<br>
                            suited for organizations such as governments,<br>
                             military, and big financial corporations were<br>
                              involved in the classified communication.</p>

                <p>Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is an encryption scheme <br>
                    that uses two mathematically related, but not identical, keys - a public key and <br>
                    a private key. Unlike symmetric key algorithms that rely on one key to both encrypt<br>
                     and decrypt, each key performs a unique function. The public key is used to encrypt<br>
                      and the private key is used to decrypt.It is computationally infeasible to compute<br>
                       the private key based on the public key. Because of this, public keys can be freely <br>
                       shared, allowing users an easy and convenient method for encrypting content and verifying<br>
                        digital signatures, and private keys can be kept secret, ensuring only the owners of the<br>
                         private keys can decrypt content and create digital signatures.Since public keys need to <br>
                         be shared but are too big to be easily remembered, they are stored on digital certificates <br>
                         for secure transport and sharing. Since private keys are not shared, they are simply stored <br>
                         in the software or operating system you use, or on hardware (e.g., USB token, hardware security<br>
                          module) containing drivers that allow it to be used with your software or operating system.</p>

                   <p>the two main business applications are for public-key<br>
                     cryptography are:<strong>Digital signatures</strong> - content is <br>
                     digitally signed with an individual’s private key and <br>
                     is verified by the individual’s public key<br>
                     <strong>Encryption</strong>- content is<br>
                      encrypted using an individual’s public key<br>
                       and can only be decrypted with the individual’s<br>
                        private key </p>

                         robust authentication is also possible.<br>
                          A sender can combine a message with a ,<br>
                          private key to create a short digital<br>
                           signature on the message. Anyone with<br>
                            the sender's corresponding public key<br>
                             can combine that message with a claimed<br>
                              digital signature; if the signature matches<br>
                               the message, the origin of the message<br>
                               is verified</p>

                        something for the RSA algorithm:<br>
                        RSA is a relatively slow algorithm.<br>
                         Because of this, it is not commonly<br>
                          used to directly encrypt user data.<br>
                           More often, RSA is used to transmit<br>
                            shared keys for symmetric key cryptography<br>
                             which are then used for bulk encryption-decryption.</p>
