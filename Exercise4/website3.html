                <p> Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where only one key (a secret key)<br>
                     is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic information. The entities <br>
                     communicating via symmetric encryption must exchange the key so that it can <br>
                     be used in the decryption process.By using symmetric encryption algorithms, data<br>
                      is converted to a form that cannot be understood by anyone who does not possess the<br>
                       secret key to decrypt it. Once the intended recipient who possesses the key has the message,<br>
                        the algorithm reverses its action so that the message is returned to its original and understandable form.<br>
                         The secret key that the sender and recipient both use could be a specific password/code or it can be random <br>
                         string of letters or numbers that have been generated by a secure random number generator (RNG).</p>

                   <p> While symmetric encryption is an older method of encryption, it is faster <br>
                    and more efficient than asymmetric encryption, which takes a toll on networks<br>
                     due to performance issues with data size and heavy CPU use. Due to the better<br>
                      performance and faster speed of symmetric encryption (compared to asymmetric),<br>
                       symmetric cryptography is typically used for bulk encryption / encrypting large<br>
                        amounts of data, e.g. for database encryption. In the case of a database, the secret <br>
                        key might only be available to the database itself to encrypt or decrypt.</p>

                                Symmetric ciphers have historically<br>
                                 been susceptible to known-plaintext attacks,<br>
                                  chosen-plaintext attacks, differential<br>
                                   cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis.<br>

                                    for each round can greatly reduce the <br>
