                        <p>Earlier cryptography was <br>
                           effectively synonymous<br>
                          with encryption but<br>
                          nowadays cryptography <br>
                           is mainly based on<br>
                           mathematical theory <br>
                           and computer science <br>
                           practice.</p>
                    </aside>
                            <p>Cryptography is associated with the process of converting ordinary plain,<br>
                                text into unintelligible text and vice-versa. It is a method of storing <br>
                                and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those for whom <br>
                                it is intended can read and process it. Cryptography not only protects<br>
                                 data from theft or alteration, but can also be used for user authentication.  </p>

                    <h3>Where is it used</h3>
    
                     <article >      
                    
                            <p> When transmitting electronic data, the most common use of cryptography is to <br>
                             encrypt and decrypt email and other plain-text messages. The simplest method uses<br>
                              the symmetric or “secret key” system. Here, data is encrypted using a secret key,<br>
                               and then both the encoded message and secret key are sent to the recipient for decryption.<br>
                                The problem? If the message is intercepted, a third party has everything they need to<br>
                                decrypt and read the message. To address this issue, cryptologists devised the asymmetric<br>
                                 or “public key” system. In this case, every user has two keys: one public and one private.<br>
                                  Senders request the public key of their intended recipient, encrypt the message and send it <br>
                                  along. When the message arrives, only the recipient’s private key will decode it meaning theft <br>
                                  is of no use without the corresponding private key</p>
